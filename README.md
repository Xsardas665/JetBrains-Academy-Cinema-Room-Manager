# Cinema Room Manager project from JetBrains Academy

### Description
#### Stage 1/5
There are many enjoyable activities on this funny little planet Earth, and still, the happiest, simplest, and most fulfilling one is probably going to the movies. Going with friends, going with loved ones, experiencing a whole new adventure from the safety of a cinema seat, surrounded by like-minded fellow travelers.  
As a beginner developer, you can contribute to creating this wonderful cinema experience. Your good friends asked you to help them create an application for a cinema theatre where people can get tickets, reserve seats, and enjoy their movie night.

#### Stage 2/5
Good job: our friends really liked your program! Now they want to expand their theater and add screen rooms with more seats. However, this is expensive, so they want to make sure this will pay off. Help them calculate the profit from all the sold tickets depending on the number of available seats.

#### Stage 3/5
When choosing a ticket you are guided not only by your space preference but also by your finances. Let's implement the opportunity to check the ticket price and see the reserved seat.


### Objectives
#### Stage 1/5
There is not a lot of space in our new cinema theatre, so you need to take into account the restrictions on the number of seats. Your friends said that the room would fit 7 rows of 8 seats. Your task is to help them visualize the seating arrangement by printing the scheme to the console.

#### Stage 2/5
In this stage, you need to read two positive integer numbers from the input: the number of rows and the number of seats in each row. The ticket price is determined by the following rules:
- If the total number of seats in the screen room is not more than 60, then the price of each ticket is 10 dollars.
- In a larger room, the tickets are 10 dollars for the front half of the rows and 8 dollars for the back half. Please note that the number of rows can be odd, for example, 9 rows. In this case, the first half is the first 4 rows, and the second half is the rest 5 rows.  

Calculate the profit from the sold tickets depending on the number of seats and print the result as shown in the examples below. After that, your program should stop. Note that in this project, the number of rows and seats won't be greater than 9.

#### Stage 3/5 
Read two positive integer numbers that represent the number of rows and seats in each row and print the seating arrangement like in the first stage. Then, read two integer numbers from the input: a row number and a seat number in that row. These numbers represent the coordinates of the seat according to which the program should print the ticket price. The ticket price is determined by the same rules as the previous stage:

- If the total number of seats in the screen room is not more than 60, then the price of each ticket is 10 dollars.
- In a larger room, the tickets are 10 dollars for the front half of the rows and 8 dollars for the back half. Please note that the number of rows can be odd, for example, 9 rows. In this case, the first half is the first 4 rows, and the second half is the rest 5 rows.

After that, the program should print out all the seats in the screen room as shown in the example and mark the chosen seat by the B symbol. Finally, it should print the ticket price and stop. Note that in this project, the number of rows and seats won't be greater than 9.
